=============

Blink is an iOS game programmed in Objective-C for my mobile game development class with three other group members. It's a simple side-scrolling game where the player can teleport and jump to dodge meteors and spikes. Level's are generated using the BlinkLevelEditor.jar, a java program that generates a json file with all the specified properties and locations of objects in the game.
